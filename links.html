	<p>Relative links i.e. 'docs/page2.html' are very valuable when you are building a page because everything will still work if you have to 'move' your page to a new server, since everything will 'move' with it...i.e. the whole file structure...</p>
	<p>Links should not have path names that are relative to my computer...i.e. C:\webpage\mypage\index.html.</p>
	<p>Here is a link that uses a picture...
		<a href="http://www.cnn.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/img/3.0/global/misc/apple-touch-icon.png" alt="">
		</a>
	</p>
	<p>The anchor attribute "target" will determine whether the browser opens a link in the current tab, or opens it in a new tab (i.e. _self, or _blank)...in the link above, the cnn.com page opens in a new tab.</p>
