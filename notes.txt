Lesson 2:
	- two types of data are always included in the head, a title and a charset.
	- good idea to validate your html code: <head> should be closed before the <body> is begun.

	02.02 - 
	<img src=""/> is a 'self-closing' tag.
	Element display: very important! "block" takes up whole line; "inline" only takes up necessary width.
	Headings are 'block' tags, i.e. h1-h6, paragraphs i.e. <p>, and <div>...
	div is a generic section 'larger' than a paragraph, that 'groups' related content.

	02.04 - we are going to create a page with all the semantic elements, which are not empty, as well as validate that page.

	Three parts to each page: doc-type, meta-data, and displayable content.

	02.07 - certain attributes for tags don't require any 'value' i.e., you just name them and they are applied...such as controls and loop in a video tag.

	02.08 - tables have historically been used incorrectly; they should really only be used if you have actual 'data' to display. Styling 'can' be used, i.e. the border tag, but this can also be controlled via CSS, so there is at least one school of thought that says "keep your content separate from they styling."
